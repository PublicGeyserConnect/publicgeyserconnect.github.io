            What is the purpose of this server?
        </h1>
        <p>
            This server is a proxy server for bedrock users. 
            It allows Bedrock (PE) players to connect to Java servers! 
            This server can be used by Win10, mobile, and even console users! 
            Console users can use this to add "custom servers" from their systems, and are presented with a list similar to BedrockConnect. 
            This server is capable of allowing Bedrock players to connect to both Bedrock and Java servers.
