This plugin allows outdated servers to accept the latest game versions that players connect from. This, unfortunately, is not a viable option for a service such as the Public GeyserConnect. There is a solution though. We also host an instance of what is know as "VIA As A Service" or VIAaaS for short. This is a proxy server that allows version mismatching. Our primary focus is the latest version to outdated servers.<br><br>Using this server is more complicated than GeyserConnect is. GeyserConnect has a really nice (subjectively speaking) user interface, while VIAaaS has <span style="font-style: italic;">no</span> user interface at all. It instead accepts arguments as part of the server address. The server address is `via.geyserconnect.net` but this will not do anything by itself. You must pass the server and sometimes the version info to it. So for instance, to connect to 2b2t you must use `2b2t.org._of._v1_12_2.via.geyserconnec.net`. the "2b2t.org" is of course the address. the "._of" uses the offline listener in the web auth page for VIAaaS (<a href="https://via-login.geyserconnect.net">https://via-login.geyserconnect.net</a>) and "._v1_12-2" tells it the server is version 1.12.2. This is a fairly confusing (imo) system to use, so join our discord and hop over to the #viaaas-help channel for some assistance in getting started.<br></span></span></big></big></big><br></div>
